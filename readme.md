# Docker + Python QR Code Generator

## Overview

This project uses Docker to containerize a Python script that generates a QR code image pointing to my GitHub profile. The QR code is generated using the `qrcode` and `Pillow` libraries in Python. The script accepts environment variables for the URL and optional styling customization.

---

## How It Works

- Docker is used to build and run a containerized Python environment.
- The script reads the `QR_DATA_URL` environment variable.
- It generates a PNG image containing a QR code for the specified URL.
- You can scan the QR code using your phoneâ€™s camera to be taken to the GitHub page.
